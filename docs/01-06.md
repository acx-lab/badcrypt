# Break repeating-key XOR

1. Determine the keysize by computing the _Hamming distance_ between two byte arrays
2. The keysize that nets the smallest normalized _Hamming distance_ is most likely the key size
3. With the computed key size, break the cipher text into blocks of keysize length
4. Transpose the blocks by lining up the bits in each block
5. Solve each block as if it were single character XOR
6. Join the result and apply the key on the entire cipher text
