# Repeating key XOR

Given a key, XOR each byte of the encrypted data each time using the next byte of the key. Once you reach the end of the key, cycle back to the beginning and repeat until the data is fully encrypted.

## Difficulties
- Hex encoding the encrypted data, comptime constraints on standard library `bytesToHex` function
- Test pretty much passed the first time it compiled, no debugging required
- Pretty much just trial an error on how to pass a slice as an argument `thing` or `&thing`
